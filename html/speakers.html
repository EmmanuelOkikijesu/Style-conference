            HEAVY METAL CODING 
        </h4>
        <P class="h7"> 
        In this unconventional talk, Chris mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks<br>
        in addition to yourlaptop, and beat out a rhythm of learning - both of code and drum<br>
        beats! You'll learn basic javascripts and css, plus beginner's heavy metal drum<br>
        patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing is better antidote to<br>
        code frustration than beating seven shades of **** out of a drum kit.
